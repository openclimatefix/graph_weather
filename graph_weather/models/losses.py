        Normalized MSE Loss as described in the paper

        This re-scales each physical variable such that it has unit-variance in the 3 hour temporal
        difference. E.g. for temperature data, divide every one at all pressure levels by
        sigma_t_3hr, where sigma^2_T,3hr is the variance of the 3 hour change in temperature,
         averaged across space (lat/lon + pressure levels) and time (100 random temporal frames).
