"""Decoders to decode from the Processor graph to the original graph with updated values

In the original paper the decoder is described as

The Decoder maps back to physical data defined on a latitude/longitude grid. The underlying graph is
again bipartite, this time mapping icosahedronâ†’lat/lon.
The inputs to the Decoder come from the Processor, plus a skip connection back to the original
state of the 78 atmospheric variables onthe latitude/longitude grid.
The output of the Decoder is the predicted 6-hour change in the 78 atmospheric variables,
which is then added to the initial state to produce the new state. We found 6 hours to be a good
balance between shorter time steps (simpler dynamics to model but more iterations required during
rollout) and longer time steps (fewer iterations required during rollout but modeling
more complex dynamics)
