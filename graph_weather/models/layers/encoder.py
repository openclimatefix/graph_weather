"""Encoders to encode from the input graph to the latent graph

In the original paper the encoder is described as

The Encoder maps from physical data defined on a latitude/longitude grid to abstract latent features
defined on an icosahedron grid.  The Encoder GNN uses a bipartite graph(lat/lonâ†’icosahedron) with
edges only between nodes in the lat/lon grid and nodes in the icosahedron grid. Put another way,
spatial and channel information in the local neighborhood of each icosahedron node is
gathered using connections to nearby lat/lon nodes.

The initial node features are the 78 atmospheric variables described in Section 2.1, plus solar
radiation, orography, land-sea mask, the day-of-year,sin(lat),cos(lat),sin(lon), and cos(lon).
The initial edge features are the positions of the lat/lon nodes connected to each icosahedron node.
These positions are provided in a local coordinate system that is defined relative
to each icosahedron node.
