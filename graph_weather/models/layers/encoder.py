"""Encoders to encode from the input graph to the latent graph

In the original paper the encoder is described as

The Encoder maps from physical data defined on a latitude/longitude grid to abstract latent features
defined on an icosahedron grid.  The Encoder GNN uses a bipartite graph(lat/lonâ†’icosahedron) with
edges only between nodes in the lat/lon grid and nodes in the icosahedron grid. Put another way,
spatial and channel information in the local neighborhood of each icosahedron node is
gathered using connections to nearby lat/lon nodes.

The initial node features are the 78 atmospheric variables described in Section 2.1, plus solar
radiation, orography, land-sea mask, the day-of-year,sin(lat),cos(lat),sin(lon), and cos(lon).
The initial edge features are the positions of the lat/lon nodes connected to each icosahedron node.
These positions are provided in a local coordinate system that is defined relative
to each icosahedron node.

In further notes, they notice that there is some hexagon instabilities in long rollouts
One possible way to change that is to do the additative noise as in the original MeshGraphNet
or mildly randomize graph connectivity in encoder, as a kind of edge Dropout
